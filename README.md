# Minesweeper

[Click here to demo our live game!](https://mmroczka.github.io/minesweeper/)

## Project Overview

This web verison of minesweeper was built primarily to get familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game itself isn't optimized, but was fun to build to get familiar with the technologies!

## Player Controls

Simply choose any level of minesweeper to start and the game timer will automatically start running. From there, mouse **left clicks are interpreted as guesses and right clicks are interpretted as flags**.

### Known Defects
* It is possible to have negative flags, but it shouldn't be
* You can continue the game after you've lost, but we should prevent additional clicks on the board itself
